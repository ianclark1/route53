[20110112]
- Added readme.txt and version_history.txt (this document).

[20110106]
- Route53HostedZone.createHostedZone() used to append a "." to the name property.  I've removed this, and now the trailing dot is required to be passed in.
- I've changed the version naming from numbered (i.e. 1) to dated (i.e. 20110106).
